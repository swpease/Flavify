# Flavify

Flavify was written using Django, jQuery, and Bootstrap. django-allauth was used for user registration.

### Purpose

My motivation for this [website](https://www.flavoration.com/) was to provide a recipe-less database of flavor combinations. The principles are the same as with the book The Flavor Bible, except this is a public platform that people could contribute to and express their opinions (like / dislike) on the combinations they'd tried. I wanted to avoid recipes for a couple of reasons: 
1. Eschewing recipes would theoretically make people rely more on their own judgment, becoming better cooks (chefs even?). 
2. Recipe reviews and comments are frequently useless. People often rate things they haven't even tried (I recognize this is still possible here), and often rate a recipe that they have modified to suit their tastes, i.e. not the actual recipe.

Of course, a website like this needs a user base, which it doesn't have. But *you* could be the first tumbling pebble of the rockslide!
